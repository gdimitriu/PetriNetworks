# PetriNetworks
Petri Networks simulator

This simulator simulate three of most common Petri Network: mPN (Mark Petri Network),mJPN (Mark Jump Petri Network) mTPN (Mark Timing Petri Network).
This simulator also simulate some basic functions for graphs and digraphs like: cyclicity, conexity, Minimum cost tree, Eulerian graph and obtain the Eulerian cycle.
The simulator was made in Visual C++ 6.0 as Multiple Interface Document.
The purpose other purpose of this simulator, except the use in the laboratory, it is a starting platform for a more comprehensive simulator for PN and Graphs.
For PN with automate generation of accessibility tree and cover graphs, eventually with transition graphs for timing network.
This simulator have two capability: one is to take a PN from a file and realise the graphical PN who can modify and simulate and second is to make the PN from scratch in full graphical capability like commercial VISIO.

NOTE: Because of the implementantion that I have use in 2003 the name of the nodes should start from 0 and has to be in sequence because the nodes are the line of the generated matrix.

In tests there are some exemples.
In HLP there is the help and some litle documentions.
